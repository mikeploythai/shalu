### Shalu!

`Shalu!` is a project created as a farewell gift to one of my best friends, Shaleen. He'll be leaving home in August, moving across the country to start his career as a software engineer! We couldn't be more proud of him, and we'll miss his presence dearly.

The app itself is a simple message board. There were plans in the beginning for it to be a Twitter knock-off that our friend group would use instead of whatever Twitter (now X) was becoming. However, I decided to scale back its scope for the time being so that I could have something ready before our surprise farewell party to him. I intend on revisiting the creation of my own private social media platform for me and my friends to use in the future.

He loved the gift, and read every message out loud. It was a very sweet moment and it made him so happy.

August 7th, 2023 - the original code has moved to the [`og` branch](https://github.com/mploythai/shalu/tree/og). The main branch will be transitioning to an Astro project that preserves the messages forever. This decision was made because the database goes to sleep after 2 weeks of inactivity, and I'd like Shaleen to be able to go back and read these messages at any time.
