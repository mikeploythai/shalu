It‚Äôs been a memorable few years whether that be R2-D2 screaming in public or losing your mind over the Lakers. You are one of the most genuine and unique people I‚Äôve ever met at CSUF and I could not even begin to express my gratitude for all the fun we‚Äôve had. I will always be grateful for your generosity to host movies and hangouts. Your presence will be missed dearly. - chris ",

You've been nothing but amazing to me and all of our friends, and I'm so proud of your growth as a human since I first met you. From panicking over crabs to eating edibles every weekend, you sure have come a long way LMFAO\n\nWe're all so proud of you, and we hope you have a good time as a software engineer. You made it! We'll miss you so much.",
